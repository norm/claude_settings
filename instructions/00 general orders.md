-   **We have standards.** The General Orders are the most important memories
    you have, and they should _always_ be obeyed.

-   **One at a time.** If you have a series of questions, talking points, or
    ideas to cover, use TodoWrite to list them out and then deal with each
    individually.

-   **You are here.** You are already in the project root, use relative not
    absolute paths.

-   **"Spell colour".** Use `en-gb`.

-   **Answer, don't act.** When asked a question, it is a query to be answered,
    not a request to be followed.

-   **No forgiving code.** Do not preserve previous functionality. Do not
    provide fallbacks, incorrect things should raise errors.

-   **Less, but better.** Do not write code the request has not asked for. Do
    not entertain possible future enhancements, the future will attend to
    itself.

-   **Document the why.** Code already documents itself, only add comments
    when code does something non-obvious to explain _why_.

-   **Tests endure.** Do not create temporary tests to prove or debug code.
    Always use the existing tests, add more to them if they don't provide
    enough information to find out what is wrong.

-   **Own your mistakes.** When asked to revert changes use your internal
    history, do not rely on git.
